								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>As of the official completion of this website, 6/13/17, I am 16 years old and my birthday is on October 1, 2000. The purpose of this website is to encompass all of my major life accomplishments, goals, and mindset as of this date. This website was made for my 4th quarter A.P. Computer Science Project. </p>
								<p>This is not my only website, you can check out my blog (which is not currently finished or in use) <a href="https://caligula8.github.io/Blog/">here</a>. </p>
								<p>If I could blunt my existence down to a single word, the word would be <i>Polymath</i>. This word was used to describe the great men of the Renaissance and Enlightenment eras who would be limitless in their capacity for development, the concept led to the notion that people should embrace all knowledge and develop their capacities as fully as possible. Today it is used to describe people who's expertise spans a significant number of different subject and areas. </p>
								<p>I try my best to learn something new every day, however difficult it may be. My interests as of now incude Daoism and Eastern Philosophy, Psychology, Carl Jung in particular, philosophy, and the life's work of Terence Mckenna, the greatest philosopher of the twentieth century. Previosly I have studied MBTI theory and the Dark Triad Personality Cluster inn depth, I stopped because I feel that I have masterd these areas.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Since 9th grade, every year I have done a long essay for the reason of just really wanting to learn about that subject and putting it into words to share with the rest of the world. Starting in 9th grade with a 9 page essay on the Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicator Theory (MBTI for short), which states that there are 16 differnt personaity types each comprised of 4 letters representing different character traits. My second essay that I wrote in 10th grade which was 17 pages was on the Dark Triad Personality Cluster, which is a personality cluster made up of the malevolent traits of Psychopathy, Narcissism, and Machiavellianism. My third essay, which somehow I got to be 40 pages, was on the War on Drugs and it's negative consequences. 
								<p>This was my first political essay, all of my essays were and will be in a meta-analysis format, combining as many studies as necessary before the reader is able to say they understand everything needed about the subject, but this was my first essay in which I had an opinion to argue. This essay was written directly as a result of me falling in love with the work and ideas of Terence Mckenna. </p>
								<p>Next year I plan to do one big essay on Daoism and possible small essays on Carl Jung and/or the I-Ching, and a biography of the ideas of Terence Mckenna is also possible.</p>

								<h3>Spartan Races</h3>
								<p>In 2016, I ran over 32 miles across 3 events in the harshest and most rugged terrain. Recieving the last piece to the trifecta medal was one of the proudest moments of my life, with each type of race, the 5 mile, the 10 mile, and the 16 mile you get both a whole medal and a third of an even larger medal. Whether it was 90 degrees or 40 degrees, not the coldest water, not the highest mountain, not the nastiest mud or the hardest obstacle could stop me from getting that banana at the finish line.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Goals</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Horace Mann, a great educator once said:</p>
								<blockquote>Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity.</blockquote>
								<p>No matter what field I go into, I will make sure that I leave my mark. Whether that be developng theories and cutting edge technology in computer science, making calligraphy works so beautiful they belong in textbooks, pushing the boundries of what is possible in the field of psychology, or writing revolutionary ideas and philosophical concepts in the novels I plan to write later on in my life.</p>
								<h3>Writing</h3>
								<p>In terms of writing, the two ideas I have for books are <i>The Human Condition</i>, which will explore the greatest strengths and weaknesses of humanity, what is done wrong and what could be done better, as well as where humanity is headed, and the second book for which I havn't figured out a name yet will be my best attempt to map and consciousness. Obviosly I won't be writing these tomorrow, I need time to develop and concretize and solidify my ideas, if all goes well I will start writing in my mid 30s or after gaining whatever I consideer to be adequate life experience.</p>
								<h3>Calligraphy and Art</h3>
								<p>There is also the goal of one day becoming a master penman. This is an award reserved for those who have achieved a distinguished and highest level of excellence in penmanship and the calligraphic arts - including Business penmanship, Ornamental and Spencerian script, Engrosser's script, Engrossing and Illumination, Offhand Flourishing and Text lettering. I currently practice at leat 5 hours a week but plan to do much more wonce I get eough time after graduating high school.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>Career</h3>
								<h4>Computer Science</h4>
								<p>In terms of a career path, computer science is my best option. I remember in 6th grade I used to watch modded Minecraft videos and was just fascinated by the youtubers programming into <a href="http://computercraft.info/wiki/Turtle">Turtles</a>, I had no clue what any of the code meant but at that moment I knew that it was my dream to program. There was a bit of doubt on whether or not I would like it when it would be taught to me before I started taking classes, but I am glad to say that it is everything I had ever hoped and enjoy practicing it as much as I did thinking about it back in 6th grade. It is something about aving absolute control over a computer that just fascinates me, the ability to create and see every virtual part.</p>
								<h4>Psychology</h4>
								<p>Even though I may claim to have been set on a path to programming since middle school, ever since I watched the TV show <i>Hannibal</i>, I have been having second thoughts. It's not often that a TV show comes around that can change your life, but <i>Hannibal</i> was made and directed so well that for the first time in my life I had considered something other than computer science as an option. The way that hannibal spoke to Will and the deep understanding Hannibal had about everyone's emotions truly moved me. It may also have to do with the fact that minus the murdering and cannibalism, Hannibal is everything I want to be as an adult; well respected and known in his field, a writer, an artist, a cook, a lover of fine things, even a calligrapher, a true polymath.</p>
								<h4>Calligraphy</h4>
								<p>Depending on how good I get and how fast, doing calligraphy as a profession is not out of the option. I believe that I would be a fool to say doing it part time at some point isn't definitely going to happen.</p>
								<h4>Religion and Theology</h4>
								<blockquote>"All in the world know the beauty of the beautiful, and in doing this they have the idea of what ugliness is; 
								They all know the skill of the skilful, and in doing this they have the idea of what the want of skill is.
								So it is that existence and non-existence give birth the one to the idea of the other; 
								That difficulty and ease produce the one the idea of the other; 
								That length and shortness fashion out the one the figure of the other; 
								That the ideas of height and lowness arise from the contrast of the one with the other; 
								That the musical notes and tones become harmonious through the relation of one with another; 
								That being before and behind give the idea of one following another.   
								Therefore the sage manages affairs without doing anything, and
								Conveys his instructions without the use of speech.  
								All things spring up, and there is not one which declines to show itself; 
								They grow, and there is no claim made for their ownership;
								They go through their processes, and there is no expectation of a reward for the results. 
								The work is accomplished, and there is no resting in it as an achievement.   
								The work is done, but how no one can see;
								'Tis this that makes the power not cease to be."
								- Tao Te Ching Chapter 2, translated by James Legge. </blockquote>
								<p>This is the least likely of the bunch and if it does happen, will happen after I have picked and started one of the above fields. This involves moving to an Asian country and dedicating either my life or a considerate portion of my life to studying eastern philosophy, mostly Daoism but Buddhism is also very interesting. ( I have no interest whatsoever in confucianism)</p>

								<h3>Calligraphy</h3>
								<p>With the goal of Master Penman in mind, I have been able to consistently practive calligraphy for at least 5 hours a week. My favorite area of calligraphy is offhand flourishing, which is calligraphy (the art of handwriting) in the absence of words. Offhand flourishing usually consists of a drawing of a bird or swan and followed by decorations and beautiful flourishes covering the rest of the paper. The image above is one of my favorite of my works to date. Even when school was at its hardest, I still found my relief in calligraphy, I would always want to learn more, read more books, and practice every chance I got</p>
