<p class="c10"><span class="c2 c4">According to Terence Mckenna, an ethnobotanist, author, and revolutionary figure in the movement of psychedelic plants as a mean to save the world, &quot;Every society chooses a small number of substances &ndash; no matter how toxic &ndash; and enshrines them in its cultural values then demonizes all other substances and uses -- and then persecutes and launches witch hunts against those users whenever some political pretext requires witch hunts and persecutions.&rdquo; With this, he was referring specifically to alcohol and tobacco, pointing out how well the government and western society has separated the stigma of drinking and smoking to that of every other drug. And this was not intended in the interview but caffeine and sugar are just as much of drugs as cocaine, but sugar is way more dangerous because westernized societies either don&#39;t understand, ignore, or refuse to advertise the risks associated with the drug. More people die of caffeine overdoses every year, than have ever died as a result of LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, DMT, or marijuana combined in the history of existence. More people are addicted to, and could not imagine life without caffeine, than the entire list of schedule 1 substances combined. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c2">People are gaining weight, becoming obese, on occasion even morbidly, all because they are unable to distinguish good from bad in a places they eat or stores they shop at. People are encouraged to consume alcohol as they turn of certain age, and expected to do so at least on occasion, and only recently to do so responsibly. Alcohol has led to approximately 88,000 deaths and 2.5 million years of potential life lost in only 4 years. 36.5% of U.S. adults are obese and yet 4 of the top 7 leading causes of death every year are known to be caused by and can be traced back to obesity (Stahre, Roeber, Kanny, Brewer, Zhang 2014). One third of all traffic related deaths are from alcohol impaired driving, in 2014, 9,967 people were killed in impaired driving accidents, 1,070 of which were under the age of 14 (NHTSA 2014). But there is a man that sits in his house and smokes cannabis, he is a criminal. There is a man with a non-violent criminal record who sells drugs because he can&rsquo;t get a job anywhere else, he deserve to be back in prison. The doctor that studies the effects of psychedelics on consciousness without the permission of the government, he is not &lsquo;fit&rsquo; to practice medicine. The woman that suffers from PTSD and the only treatment that could help is MDMA assisted psychotherapy, well she can keep suffering because that treatment is illegal. This is what the War on Drugs has done, nobody is proud, nobody is happy, our lives are getting worse by the day and the government can&rsquo;t function as a whole well enough to to stop it, or even care.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c4 c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p></body></html>
