<p class="c9"><span class="c7 c8">&ldquo;The war on drugs was never meant to be won. Instead, it will be prolonged as long as possible in order to allow various intelligence operations to wring the last few hundreds of millions of dollars in illicit profits from the global drug scam; then defeat will have to be declared. &quot;Defeat&quot; will mean, as it did in the case of the Vietnam War, that the media will correctly portray the true dimensions of the situation and the real players, and that public revulsion at the culpability, stupidity and venality of the Establishment&#39;s role will force a policy review.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7">Terence McKenna,</span><span class="c8 c7">&nbsp;Food of the Gods: The Search for the Original Tree of Knowledge</span></p><p class="c9 c12"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">The </span><span class="c0">War on Drugs killed millions, cost the country billions, and wasted an unimaginable number of manhours in the pursuit of an unreachable goal, this war, was the biggest failure the country has ever seen because of the amount of terror that has come as a result as well as lives ruined without any reasonable justification as to why. With all of this said and done, and just under 30 years of the government waging war against its citizens, it is good to say that progress has been made. Made not in the direction of stopping drug users (sadly), but in ending the war on drugs. Johann Hari believes that &ldquo;The one thing you can say about the drug war in is defense, is we gave it a fair shot&rdquo;, alternatives are being emerging all over the world, and they work (Hari 2015).</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c0">In the May of 2009, it was announced that Obama administration would no longer use the term &ldquo;War on Drugs&rdquo; because the term was &ldquo;counterproductive&rdquo; to the forward progression of the country. The Obama administration had done what had never been done before, and that was to recognise that the War on Drugs is not a war against any substance. But instead instead a war of incarceration and persecution of whatever person that happens to possess whichever specified drug included in the controlled substances act of 1970. Obama had reduced 248 individual sentences as well as focused on strengthening rehabilitation programs. A commitment for the first time ever had been shown to an actual reform to the Justice system about drug associated, nonviolent sentences. </span></p><p class="c13"><span class="c1">There is also the emergence of new research companies that are reevaluating and objectifying the effects of illegal drugs believed to have medical benefits. MAPS or The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies is the most notable and has several ongoing studies regarding psychedelic assisted psychotherapy. Some of these substances being medical marijuana, LSD, ayahuasca, psilocybin, ibogaine, and most Notably MDMA. MAPS is undertaking a roughly $25 million plan to make MDMA into a FDA approved prescription medicine by 2021, and is currently the only organization in the world funding clinical trials of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
