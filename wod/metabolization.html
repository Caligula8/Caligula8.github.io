<h3>Postface</h3>
<p>This did not make it into the essay due to
the topics being too controvercil for me to comfortably add to an
acedemic paper, and ddue to irrelevence from the argument. I was
going to refer the reader to my autobiography anyway so I may as well
place the story behind the essay with it</font></p>
<p>This essay was made in interest of harm
reduction, awareness, and political protest. There are far too many
individuals operating day to day under false assumptions and radical
beliefs based on no scientific evidence or even just plain
brainwashing from birth by the definition of it. I’m not going to
sugar coat it, people are dying because the U.S. government has no
clue what they’re doing. Not only are the broken policies and laws
responsible both directly and indirectly for more deaths than any
other man caused event, organization, or government in the world, but
the U.S. government has managed to spend over a trillion dollars
while legitimizing the war in every way possible, and I have a
problem with that.</p>
<p>Terence Mckenna was an American
ethnobotanist, lecturer, writer, philosopher, and psychonaut who’s
life goal was to promote the responsible use of naturally occurring
plant based hallucinogens. In his interviews, lectures, and books,
the topics he discussed ranged across psychedelic drugs, plant-based
entheogens, shamanism, metaphysics, alchemy, language, philosophy,
culture, technology, environmentalism, and the theoretical origins of
human consciousness. Many of his beliefs may seem crazy at first such
as his Timewave-Zero theory or the claim to the existence of machine
elves, but his conceptual imagination in language so potent and
eloquent that within the first hour of listening to him speak, he
almost always completely shifts or transcends the listeners reality
from what it previously was, regardless of the lecture. He has the
most extraordinary aptitude to describe nature and subjective
experiences under the influence of hallucinogens in the most
extraordinarily lucid detail.</font></p>
<p><font color="#ffffff">Note that my love for the ideas and work of
Terence Mckenna does not mean that I condone the use of any illegal
substance in areas in which they are illegal, I very much enjoy the
perks of being a law abiding citizen and do not plan to even go near
any psychedelic substance until much later in my life (30-40 years
old). At that point my options would be (assuming the laws regarding
drug legality stay the same in which case they won’t) either
therapeutic Ayahuasca session(s) under the influence of a Shaman or
Psilocybin truffles in the Netherlands which are completely legal. </font>
</p>
<p><font color="#ffffff">Terence mckenna is however the reason I
wrote this essay; the issues he raised against society and culture
were very legitimate and ever since, even before I thought about
writing this essay, I have been researching every possible resource I
could find to better educate myself on the subject. </font>
</p>
<p><font color="#ffffff">This essay started off as a history research
paper, I decided to pick my topic to be The War on Drugs due to my
recent and growing interest in Terence Mckenna at the time This was
before I switched topics from Taoism for my personal annual essay so
I didn’t think that the 5 page limit would be a problem since I
didn’t plan for this to be my long essay for the year. The next
thing I knew it was 3am the night before the research paper was due
and I had 13 pages done with no intent of stopping anytime soon Right
before I submitted I just took out the least important parts of what
was there and thought, I didn’t even care about my research paper
grade anymore, this essay was far too important and interesting for
me to stop there, and looking back I don’t regret it. </font>
</p>
<p><font color="#ffffff">The greatest struggle with this paper was
definitely my sleeping habits, there was a period of 5 months where
almost no progress was made because of how bad my sleeping schedule
got and how unmotivated I was, I wasn’t doing homework, I wasn’t
studying for school, I didn’t get a single productive thing done in
that whole period of time. Even now it's slightly better but I’m
still recovering. The fact that I had this obstacle does make it a
much greater personal accomplishment that I finished and got the
essay to 40 pages than if I didn’t have any sleeping problems.</font></p>
